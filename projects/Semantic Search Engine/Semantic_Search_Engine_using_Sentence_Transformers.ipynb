            "The Janasena Party (lit. 'People's Army Party'; abbr. JSP) is an Indian political party active in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Founded by Pawan Kalyan on 14 March 2014, it is currently the second largest party in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and a partner in the ruling coalition. Pawan Kalyan, the party leader, has been serving as the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. Janasena advocates for a centrist approach with a focus on humanism. The party's election symbol is a glass tumbler.\n",
            "Janasena did not contest the 2014 elections, but its support was crucial for the victory of the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh. The party gained prominence for highlighting issues such as the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam in 2017, which was described by the WHO as \"the least understood and the least publicized nephropathy.\" It later led protests against forced land acquisition, illegal mining in reserved forests, and drought-related issues in 2018.\n",
            "In 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat and securing approximately 6% of the vote share. Subsequently, it focused on grassroots issues, including farmer welfare, illegal sand mining, women's safety, and land encroachment. In early 2024, Pawan Kalyan played a key role in the formation of an alliance between the JSP, TDP and BJP, known as Kūṭami (lit. 'Alliance'). The alliance achieved a landslide victory in both the general and state legislative assembly elections, with the JSP winning all 21 MLA seats and two MP seats it contested, becoming a significant part of the ruling coalition in Andhra Pradesh.\n",

            "== Ideology ==\n",
            "The main goal of the Janasena Party is to question any type of corruption in government functioning and organizations and to protect the basic rights of people. Janasena follows seven basic ideals promoted as 'Ideals of Janasena' ('Janasena Sidhanthalu' in Telugu):\n",
            "\n",
            "Mindset that unites different castes\n",
            "Politics without religious discrimination\n",
            "Tradition that reveres linguistic diversity\n",
            "Society that protects our traditions and culture\n",
            "Nationalism that does not neglect regional aspirations\n",
            "Relentless fight against corruption\n",
            "Development that preserves the environment\n",
            "The party founder and president, Pawan Kalyan, has often stated that he believes in a centrist path, and in maintaining a balance or a middle ground between right and left ideologies. He added, \"Many people say we don’t understand your -ism. I say to them that my -ism is humanism.\" He also mentioned that he follows Sanatana Dharma but also respects other religions.\n",

            "Kalyan formally launched the party at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre (HICC) in Madhapur, Hyderabad, on 14 March 2014 with a massive meeting. The party was named Janasena (transl. People's Army), and Kalyan urged people to challenge those in power. He unveiled the party's flag and objectives at the event attended by 6,000 people. Kalyan criticized the Congress Party high command for the state's issues, accusing them of dividing the state without addressing the people's concerns.\n",
            "The party held its second public meeting in Visakhapatnam on March 27, 2014, where Kalyan launched the book Ism, co-authored with Raju Raviteja. The Election Commission approved the party on November 28, 2014.\n",

            "Pawan Kalyan chose not to contest in the 2014 elections, instead supporting and campaigning extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance. Kalyan campaigned against the Congress party, giving the slogan \"Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao\" (transl. Remove Congress, Save the Nation). His rallies drew huge crowds in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. His support and campaigning played a crucial role in the TDP-led National Democratic Alliance's victory in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections.\n",

            "\n",
            "==== Campaign for Special Category Status ====\n",
            "In September 2016, Pawan Kalyan's public criticism of the BJP and TDP over the delay in granting Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh led to increased political pressure. Ten days after Kalyan's Tirupati meeting, where he condemned the central government's inaction, the Union Government announced a 'special package' for the state in a midnight press conference. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu accepted the package, but Kalyan, at a massive public gathering named Seemandhrula Atma Gaurava Sabha in Kakinada on 9 September 2016, dismissed the concessions as eyewash, resonating with public sentiment and further criticizing Naidu’s compliance with the BJP. One political commentator described the announcement of the special package as a 'political victory' for Pawan Kalyan, highlighting his significant influence.\n",
            "In November 2016, it was announced that the first office of the Janasena Party (JSP) would be established in Anantapur the following year, with plans to contest the 2019 general election.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "==== Spotlight on the Uddanam kidney disease crisis ====\n",
            "Pawan Kalyan brought attention to the Uddanam kidney disease issue in Srikakulam district by requesting Harvard University doctors to participate in clinical research on local kidney problems. He subsequently held a meeting in Visakhapatnam with these Harvard doctors and local scientists. Kalyan also met with Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu to discuss the Uddanam situation, leading to the establishment of a dialysis centre in the region. In May 2018, he went on a one-day hunger strike for proper care of patients in Uddanam in May 2018.\n",
            "On 21 February 2017, Kalyan announced that he would launch a website on 14 March to mark the party's anniversary and invite recommendations for the party manifesto in the 2019 general election.\n",
            "The fourth formation day of JSP was conducted at Acharya Nagarjuna University grounds on March 14, 2018. Kalyan criticized both central and state governments in this meeting. He mainly targeted Arun Jaitley, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh for their poor governance and alleged corruption. He said, \"I supported the TDP and the BJP parties during the general elections held in 2014 with the hope that they would rebuild the state which had no Capital and no financial resources. But the state government has belied my hopes and the aspirations of crores of people. Why should I support these parties which have betrayed the people?\" He questioned Chandrababu Naidu about his son's alleged corruption.\n",
            "In December 2017, Kalyan opposed the central government's move to privatize the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI). In July 2018, he opposed the TDP government's decision on forced land pooling. In October 2018, he organized a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage, Rajahmundry, demanding political accountability. In November 2018, he exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserved forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu, East Godavari district. In December 2018, he led a protest march to condole the families of farmers who committed suicide or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema. The prime objective of Janasena Party has been to ensure equal power to all social groups of people.\n",

JSP formed a bloc with the Bahujan Samaj Party, Communist Party of India, and Communist Party of India (Marxist). Kalyan contested two seats in the election, Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram. He failed to win either seat. JSP candidate, Rapaka Vara Prasada Rao, was elected from Razole Assembly constituency. The party managed to get around 6% vote share in Andhra Pradesh.\n",
            "Manifesto\n",
            "Kalyan released the party's 2019 election manifesto on the fifth formation day of JSP at Rajahmundry. The party declared war on unemployment and corruption and wished to ensure the safety of women. Other goals included:\n",

            "Ten lakh (one million) jobs every year\n",
            "After the 2019 setback, Janasena focused on highlighting issues like farmer welfare, transparent governance, poor infrastructure, illegal sand mining, women's safety, land encroachment etc. On 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers, against YSR Congress Party, who have been facing unemployment due to a shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh. On 16 January 2020, Kalyan announced his party's alliance with the BJP, after three years of distancing from it. On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool. He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident. In late 2022, Kalyan started 'Jana Vani,' a series of small public meetings to hear people's grievances.\n",

The vehicle used for the trip is a camper van having facilities like a bed, cooking appliances, a bathroom, and a compact meeting area. The tour also included the 'Jana Vani' programme, where the party received petitions from people seeking redressal of their grievances. Later, the grievances were to the notice of the concerned authorities to get them addressed.\n",
            "The first phase of the yatra started with darshan at Satyanarayana Swamy temple in Annavaram on 14 June and was drawn to a close at Bhimavaram on 30 June. Kalyan toured Prathipadu, Pithapuram, Kakinada urban, Kakinada rural, Mummidivaram, Amalapuram, P. Gannavaram, Narasapuram, Razole, Palakollu, and Bhimavaram constituencies in the first phase.

In March 2024, TDP rejoined the NDA for legislative elections and 2024 General Elections, effectively making it a tri-party alliance, or Kutami, in Andhra Pradesh. Kalyan played a key role in forging the alliance between JSP, TDP and BJP by limiting the number of seats his party contested. The alliance swept to power in a landslide victory, with Janasena winning each of the seats it contested — 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats. Kalyan was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Pitapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes.\n",
            "After the 2024 elections, the Janasena Party (JSP) attained eligibility for recognized party status. According to the Election Commission's guidelines, a party can achieve state party status by securing at least three per cent of the total number of seats. JSP exceeded this threshold by winning 13% of the seats in the state, qualifying for the status.\n",

He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development & Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forests, Science & Technology.\n",
            "On the same day, two other Janasena legislators and Pawan Kalyan were sworn in as ministers. Nadendla Manohar became the Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Consumer Affairs, while Kandula Durgesh became the Minister for Tourism, Culture, and Cinematography.\n",
            "On 5 July 2024, P. Hari Prasad was elected unopposed as a member of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council under the MLA quota, becoming the first MLC from the Janasena Party. On 24 July 2024, Janasena made key appointments for the party within the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. Tenali MLA, Nadendla Manohar, was designated as the Deputy Floor Leader of the party, while Lokam Naga Madhavi, the MLA of Nellimarla, was appointed as the Chief Whip. Bhimavaram MLA, Pulaparthi Ramanjaneyulu has been appointed as the Treasurer. Visakhapatnam South MLA Vamsi Krishna Yadav, and Razole MLA Deva Varaprasad have been appointed as Secretaries.\n",

              "['The Janasena Party (lit.\\u2009\\'People\\'s Army Party\\'; abbr. JSP) is an Indian political party active in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Founded by Pawan Kalyan on 14 March 2014, it is currently the second largest party in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly and a partner in the ruling coalition. Pawan Kalyan, the party leader, has been serving as the Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. Janasena advocates for a centrist approach with a focus on humanism. The party\\'s election symbol is a glass tumbler.\\nJanasena did not contest the 2014 elections, but its support was crucial for the victory of the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh. The party gained prominence for highlighting issues such as the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam in 2017, which was described by the WHO as \"the least understood and the least publicized nephropathy.\" It later led protests against forced land acquisition, illegal mining in reserved forests, and drought-related issues in 2018.\\nIn 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat and securing approximately 6% of the vote share. Subsequently, it focused on grassroots issues, including farmer welfare, illegal sand mining, women\\'s safety, and land encroachment. In early 2024, Pawan Kalyan played a key role in the formation of an alliance between the JSP, TDP and BJP, known as Kūṭami (lit.\\u2009\\'Alliance\\'). The alliance achieved a landslide victory in both the general and state legislative assembly elections, with the JSP winning all 21 MLA seats and two MP seats it contested, becoming a significant part of the ruling coalition in Andhra Pradesh.\\n\\n\\n== Ideology ==\\nThe main goal of the Janasena Party is to question any type of corruption in government functioning and organizations and to protect the basic rights of people. Janasena follows seven basic ideals promoted as \\'Ideals of Janasena\\' (\\'Janasena Sidhanthalu\\' in Telugu):\\n\\nMindset that unites different castes\\nPolitics without religious discrimination\\nTradition that reveres linguistic diversity\\nSociety that protects our traditions and culture\\nNationalism that does not neglect regional aspirations\\nRelentless fight against corruption\\nDevelopment that preserves the environment\\nThe party founder and president, Pawan Kalyan, has often stated that he believes in a centrist path, and in maintaining a balance or a middle ground between right and left ideologies. He added, \"Many people say we don’t understand your -ism. I say to them that my -ism is humanism.\" He also mentioned that he follows Sanatana Dharma but also respects other religions.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Formation ===\\nOn 12 March 2014, it was officially announced that Telugu matinée idol and philanthropist Pawan Kalyan, was launching a new political party. In preparation for the launch, Kalyan reportedly visited Delhi to register the party with the Election Commission of India (ECI).\\nKalyan formally launched the party at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre (HICC) in Madhapur, Hyderabad, on 14 March 2014 with a massive meeting. The party was named Janasena (transl.\\u2009People\\'s Army), and Kalyan urged people to challenge those in power. He unveiled the party\\'s flag and objectives at the event attended by 6,000 people. Kalyan criticized the Congress Party high command for the state\\'s issues, accusing them of dividing the state without addressing the people\\'s concerns.\\nThe party held its second public meeting in Visakhapatnam on March 27, 2014, where Kalyan launched the book Ism, co-authored with Raju Raviteja. The Election Commission approved the party on November 28, 2014.\\n\\n\\n=== 2014–2019 ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2014 elections ====\\nPawan Kalyan chose not to contest in the 2014 elections, instead supporting and campaigning extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alliance. Kalyan campaigned against the Congress party, giving the slogan \"Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao\" (transl.\\u2009Remove Congress, Save the Nation). His rallies drew huge crowds in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. His support and campaigning played a crucial role in the TDP-led National Democratic Alliance\\'s victory in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections.\\n\\n\\n==== Campaign for Special Category Status ====\\nIn September 2016, Pawan Kalyan\\'s public criticism of the BJP and TDP over the delay in granting Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh led to increased political pressure. Ten days after Kalyan\\'s Tirupati meeting, where he condemned the central government\\'s inaction, the Union Government announced a \\'special package\\' for the state in a midnight press conference. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu accepted the package, but Kalyan, at a massive public gathering named Seemandhrula Atma Gaurava Sabha in Kakinada on 9 September 2016, dismissed the concessions as eyewash, resonating with public sentiment and further criticizing Naidu’s compliance with the BJP. One political commentator described the announcement of the special package as a \\'political victory\\' for Pawan Kalyan, highlighting his significant influence.\\nIn November 2016, it was announced that the first office of the Janasena Party (JSP) would be established in Anantapur the following year, with plans to contest the 2019 general election.\\n\\n\\n==== Spotlight on the Uddanam kidney disease crisis ====\\nPawan Kalyan brought attention to the Uddanam kidney disease issue in Srikakulam district by requesting Harvard University doctors to participate in clinical research on local kidney problems. He subsequently held a meeting in Visakhapatnam with these Harvard doctors and local scientists. Kalyan also met with Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu to discuss the Uddanam situation, leading to the establishment of a dialysis centre in the region. In May 2018, he went on a one-day hunger strike for proper care of patients in Uddanam in May 2018.\\nOn 21 February 2017, Kalyan announced that he would launch a website on 14 March to mark the party\\'s anniversary and invite recommendations for the party manifesto in the 2019 general election.\\nThe fourth formation day of JSP was conducted at Acharya Nagarjuna University grounds on March 14, 2018. Kalyan criticized both central and state governments in this meeting. He mainly targeted Arun Jaitley, N. Chandrababu Naidu and Nara Lokesh for their poor governance and alleged corruption. He said, \"I supported the TDP and the BJP parties during the general elections held in 2014 with the hope that they would rebuild the state which had no Capital and no financial resources. But the state government has belied my hopes and the aspirations of crores of people. Why should I support these parties which have betrayed the people?\" He questioned Chandrababu Naidu about his son\\'s alleged corruption.\\nIn December 2017, Kalyan opposed the central government\\'s move to privatize the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI). In July 2018, he opposed the TDP government\\'s decision on forced land pooling. In October 2018, he organized a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage, Rajahmundry, demanding political accountability. In November 2018, he exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserved forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu, East Godavari district. In December 2018, he led a protest march to condole the families of farmers who committed suicide or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema. The prime objective of Janasena Party has been to ensure equal power to all social groups of people.\\n\\n\\n=== 2019–2024 ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2019 elections ====\\nOn 2 May 2018, the JSP announced that it would contest all 175 assembly seats in Andhra Pradesh during the 2019 assembly election. JSP formed a bloc with the Bahujan Samaj Party, Communist Party of India, and Communist Party of India (Marxist). Kalyan contested two seats in the election, Gajuwaka and Bhimavaram. He failed to win either seat. JSP candidate, Rapaka Vara Prasada Rao, was elected from Razole Assembly constituency. The party managed to get around 6% vote share in Andhra Pradesh.\\nManifesto\\nKalyan released the party\\'s 2019 election manifesto on the fifth formation day of JSP at Rajahmundry. The party declared war on unemployment and corruption and wished to ensure the safety of women. Other goals included:\\n\\nIrrigation support fund of ₹8,000 per acre to every farmer\\'s family\\nDokka Seethamma canteens, which provide free food for students\\n₹5,000 pension for small, marginal and tenant farmers above 60 years of age and free solar pump sets for all farmers\\nArts and science college at every mandal level\\n₹10 lakh (one million rupees) free health insurance, and mobile diagnostic centres in all mandals\\n₹10,000 financial support at 25 paisa interest to small businesses\\nImplementation of Sachar Committee recommendations\\nFree education from LKG to PG\\nFree liquefied petroleum gas cylinders for housewives\\nFinancial support for fishermen during the non-fishing season\\nHigh court bench in Rayalaseema\\nChief minister (CM) to be brought under Lokayukta\\n33% reservations for women in the state legislature and establishment of Mahila banks in all districts\\nTen lakh (one million) jobs every year\\nAfter the 2019 setback, Janasena focused on highlighting issues like farmer welfare, transparent governance, poor infrastructure, illegal sand mining, women\\'s safety, land encroachment etc. On 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers, against YSR Congress Party, who have been facing unemployment due to a shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh. On 16 January 2020, Kalyan announced his party\\'s alliance with the BJP, after three years of distancing from it. On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was raped and murdered, in Kurnool. He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident. In late 2022, Kalyan started \\'Jana Vani,\\' a series of small public meetings to hear people\\'s grievances.\\n\\n\\n==== 2023 Varahi Yatra ====\\nIn 2023, Kalyan undertook a tour in the state on a customized vehicle named Varahi, aimed at highlighting the failures of Jagan Mohan Reddy\\'s administration. The vehicle used for the trip is a camper van having facilities like a bed, cooking appliances, a bathroom, and a compact meeting area. The tour also included the \\'Jana Vani\\' programme, where the party received petitions from people seeking redressal of their grievances. Later, the grievances were to the notice of the concerned authorities to get them addressed.\\nThe first phase of the yatra started with darshan at Satyanarayana Swamy temple in Annavaram on 14 June and was drawn to a close at Bhimavaram on 30 June. Kalyan toured Prathipadu, Pithapuram, Kakinada urban, Kakinada rural, Mummidivaram, Amalapuram, P. Gannavaram, Narasapuram, Razole, Palakollu, and Bhimavaram constituencies in the first phase. The second phase of the Varahi Yatra began with a public meeting in Eluru town on 9 July.\\n\\n\\n=== 2024–present ===\\n\\n\\n==== 2024 elections ====\\nOn 14 September 2023, Kalyan announced via a press conference, that the JSP and TDP would jointly fight the 2024 Andhra Pradesh legislative elections. In March 2024, TDP rejoined the NDA for legislative elections and 2024 General Elections, effectively making it a tri-party alliance, or Kutami, in Andhra Pradesh. Kalyan played a key role in forging the alliance between JSP, TDP and BJP by limiting the number of seats his party contested. The alliance swept to power in a landslide victory, with Janasena winning each of the seats it contested — 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats. Kalyan was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Pitapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes.\\nAfter the 2024 elections, the Janasena Party (JSP) attained eligibility for recognized party status. According to the Election Commission\\'s guidelines, a party can achieve state party status by securing at least three per cent of the total number of seats. JSP exceeded this threshold by winning 13% of the seats in the state, qualifying for the status.\\n\\n\\n==== Janasena in coalition government ====\\nOn 12 June 2024, party president Pawan Kalyan was sworn in as a cabinet minister in the Government of Andhra Pradesh, and on 16 June 2024, he was announced as the Deputy Chief Minister. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development & Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forests, Science & Technology.\\nOn the same day, two other Janasena legislators and Pawan Kalyan were sworn in as ministers. Nadendla Manohar became the Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Consumer Affairs, while Kandula Durgesh became the Minister for Tourism, Culture, and Cinematography.\\nOn 5 July 2024, P. Hari Prasad was elected unopposed as a member of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council under the MLA quota, becoming the first MLC from the Janasena Party. On 24 July 2024, Janasena made key appointments for the party within the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. Tenali MLA, Nadendla Manohar, was designated as the Deputy Floor Leader of the party, while Lokam Naga Madhavi, the MLA of Nellimarla, was appointed as the Chief Whip. Bhimavaram MLA, Pulaparthi Ramanjaneyulu has been appointed as the Treasurer. Visakhapatnam South MLA Vamsi Krishna Yadav, and Razole MLA Deva Varaprasad have been appointed as Secretaries.\\nIn October 2024, amidst the Tirupati Laddu controversy, Pawan Kalyan issued a clarion call through his Varahi declaration in Tirupati, advocating for the formation of a board dedicated to protecting temples and Hindu interests..\\n\\n\\n==== Membership Milestone ====\\nIn early August 2024, the Janasena Party (JSP) reached a major milestone by exceeding one million members. The party, which had set a goal to enrol one million new members within the year, achieved this target as reported in August 2024, compared to 6.47 lakh done in 2023 and 3.50 lakh and 1 lakh in 2022 and 2021 respectively. The growth was highlighted by party leaders, including Nadendla Manohar, who underscored the significance of this expansion for the party’s future political initiatives.\\n\\n\\n== Leadership ==\\n\\n\\n=== Political Affairs Committee ===\\n\\n\\n=== Others ===\\n\\n\\n== Electoral performance ==\\n\\n\\n=== Indian general elections ===\\n\\n\\n=== State legislative assembly elections ===\\n\\n\\n== List of party leaders ==\\n\\n\\n=== Presidents ===\\n\\n\\n== Legislative leaders ==\\n\\n\\n=== List of deputy chief ministers ===\\n\\n\\n==== Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh ====\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nPolitics of India\\nElections in India\\nPolitics of Andhra Pradesh\\nElections in Andhra Pradesh\\nList of political parties in India\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nThe Janasena Party, which won 21 seats, has a vote share of 8.53%',\n",
              " 'Konidela Chiranjeevi (born Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad; 22 August 1955) is an Indian actor, politician, and philanthropist known for his work in Telugu cinema. Known as the \"Mega Star\", he is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Chiranjeevi holds the record for the most \"Industry Hits\" in Telugu cinema, with eight films emerging as the top-grossers of their time—a feat unmatched by any actor in the industry\\'s 100-year history. He is also celebrated as one of the finest dancers in Indian cinema. He has received numerous honours, including the Padma Bhushan in 2006 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2024 from the Government of India, as well as the IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award in 2022. His other accolades include the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, three Nandi Awards, and nine Filmfare Awards South, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry. \\nChiranjeevi made his acting debut in 1978, initially gaining recognition for his supporting, anti-hero, and antagonist roles. He later transitioned to lead roles with notable success. His breakthrough came with the 1983 film Khaidi, which became the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time and established him as a leading actor in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Chiranjeevi starred in various \"Industry Hits\"—highest-grossers of all time—like Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988), Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu (1989), Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), Gang Leader (1991), and Gharana Mogudu (1992). Notably, Gharana Mogudu was the first South Indian film to earn over ₹10 crore in distributor share, prompting The Week magazine to label him \"Bigger than Bachchan\" and \"the new money machine.\"\\nFor his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), Chiranjeevi was paid ₹1.25 crore, making him the highest-paid actor in India at the time and the first Indian actor to command a ₹1 crore remuneration for a film. During this period, he received widespread critical acclaim for his performances in Swayamkrushi (1987), Rudraveena (1988), and Aapadbandhavudu (1992), showcasing his versatility as an actor who excelled in both commercial blockbusters and critically acclaimed films. Notably, Swayamkrushi was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, while Rudraveena, which he co-produced, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chiranjeevi continued to dominate the box office with films like Master (1997), and Choodalani Vundi (1998). His 2002 film Indra was the highest-grossing Telugu film for many years, and socially impactful films like Tagore (2003) and Shankar Dada M.B.B.S. (2004) became major blockbusters, further cementing his legacy.\\nOn 2 October 1998, Chiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust, which operates the largest blood and eye banks in the Telugu states. The trust has restored eyesight to over 9,000 individuals through cornea transplants and provides 70% of collected blood free to the poor. It has received several accolades, including the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" from the Government of Andhra Pradesh for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. In 2002, he was honoured with the Samman Award by the Income Tax Department, for being the highest income tax payer in the profession category for the assessment year 1999–2000.\\nIn 2008, Chiranjeevi founded the Praja Rajyam Party and led it in the 2009 Andhra Pradesh elections, where it won 18 seats and secured over 16% of the vote, making it the third-largest party in the state.

A year following the release of the highly successful 2014 Tamil film Kaththi, Chiranjeevi chose to remake that film in Telugu as his comeback film. The remake, titled Khaidi No. 150, directed by V. V. Vinayak, was released during the Sankranti holiday in 2017, about six months short of a decade following Shankar Dada Zindabad, to positive reviews. Critics have singled out Chiranjeevi in particular, praising him for both his performance and appearance, especially following a decade of absence from cinema. The movie collected ₹41.75 crore on its opening day and grossed ₹164 crore in its lifetime. In 2019, he starred in his first period film Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy based on the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy; it was directed by Surender Reddy.

The film had Salman Khan in an extended cameo role and was largely successful. GodFather subsequently released on Netflix.\\nChiranjeevi then starred in the 2023 film Waltair Veerayya directed by Bobby Kolli which released during the Sankranti festival. The film also starred Ravi Teja in an important role, reuniting them on screen after 23 years since the 2000 film Annayya. The film met huge commercial success. Waltair Veerayya later released on Netflix for streaming. In the same year, he also appeared in Bhola Shankar, a remake of the 2015 Tamil blockbuster, Vedalam. However, it opened to unanimously negative reviews and was a huge disaster at the box-office.\\nHe announced his next film, Vishwambhara (2025), with Mallidi Vassishta of Bimbisara (2022) fame.\\n\\n\\n== Other work ==\\nChiranjeevi is one of the co-owners of the Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC.\\n\\n\\n=== Television career ===\\nChiranjeevi made his debut as a Television host with the fourth season of Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu. The first episode of the fourth season was aired on 13 February 2017 on Star Maa. The game show is a Telugu-language adaptation of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.\\n\\n\\n== Political career ==\\nIn August 2008, Chiranjeevi launched his political party, Praja Rajyam Party, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. At the launch, he stated that social justice was the main agenda of his party. In the 2009 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the party won 18 of the 294 seats and secured a vote share of over 16%. He contested from Tirupati and Palakollu constituencies winning in Tirupati but losing out in Palakollu, in West Godavari district.\\n\\nOn 6 February 2011, the Praja Rajyam Party merged with the Indian National Congress after two weeks of talks with Congress President Sonia Gandhi. The merger was influenced by the Congress party\\'s concerns over a no-confidence motion in the Andhra Pradesh state assembly, spurred by the rise of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy\\'s YSR Congress Party and the ongoing Telangana agitation. On 29 March 2012, Chiranjeevi was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, where he was elected and took his oath as a member on 3 April. Later that year, on 28 October, he was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism. In 2013, Chiranjeevi inaugurated the Incredible India Exhibition, a collaboration between the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. He also represented Incredible India at the 14th IIFA Awards ceremony held in Macau that same year.\\nAfter the split of the state of Andhra Pradesh leaving the residuary state with huge debt and little revenue in June 2014, most members of the Andhra Pradesh wing of Congress party left in protest. Chiranjeevi, however, remained with Congress and campaigned for it as chairman of Election Campaign Committee for 2014 parliamentary and assembly elections in the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. However, he refrained from contesting in elections. There was also speculation that he did not campaign wholeheartedly due to the one-sided decision taken to split Andhra Pradesh. His younger brother, Pawan Kalyan, a former Praja Rajyam Party youth wing leader, launched his own political party, Jana Sena Party, and campaigned vigorously against Congress and in favour of Telugu Desam Party and Bharatiya Janata Party. Due to the strong anti-Congress sentiment prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, its candidates were defeated in all parliamentary and state assembly seats of Andhra Pradesh.\\nSince the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then, has not attended any meetings of the Congress party, on a regional or national level. His tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018. Although he is currently not active in politics, he was issued with a new All India Congress Committee identity card in 2022 leading to the speculation of his political comeback.\\n\\n\\n== Humanitarian work ==\\nChiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT) on 2 October 1998, with the motto that no one should lose their life due to a lack of blood. The trust includes a blood bank and an eye bank and is the largest recipient of blood and eye donations in Andhra Pradesh. As of September 2022, CCT has collected over 930,000 units of blood, with 70% of it provided to the poor free of charge. It has restored eyesight to over 9,060 individuals through 4,580 cornea transplants, and more than 350,000 people have pledged their eyes to CCT. The trust has received several accolades, including the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" from the Andhra Pradesh State Government for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. On 10 June 2006, the then President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi has supported the trust\\'s activities through his earnings, including those from television commercials and promotions.\\nAfter Chiranjeevi\\'s entry into politics, actor couple Rajasekhar and Jeevitha made allegations against the Chiranjeevi Blood Bank, accusing it of engaging in financial irregularities. In response, the Andhra Pradesh state government formed a high-level committee to investigate the claims. The committee, guided by the project director of the AP State AIDS Control Society and composed of experts from finance and technical fields, thoroughly examined records related to blood collection and disposal, blood grouping, screening, sterilization, medical waste management, conducted camps, blood expiry, quality control, storage facilities, and equipment purchases. Following the investigation, the blood bank was cleared of any wrongdoing. Authorities confirmed that the blood bank operates in full compliance with the guidelines set by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). In 2023, a Nampally court sentenced Rajasekhar and Jeevitha to one year in jail and imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh for their defamatory remarks against the blood bank. The couple, however, obtained bail.\\nIn May 2021, Chiranjeevi set up oxygen banks and ambulances across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to meet the needs of patients affected by COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards, honours and recognitions ==\\nDirector K. Balachander said, \"Chiranjeevi has both Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in him. Not only can he do action, he can also act.\" Chiranjeevi received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in India in the year 2006. In the same year, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Andhra University for his contribution to films and his social service through the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust. He is a nine-time winner of Filmfare Awards South and a three-time winner of Nandi Awards. He was the first actor from South India to be invited to the Oscars ceremony in 1987. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2014, he was awarded International Face of Indian Cinema at the 3rd South Indian International Movie Awards by Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor.

After a brief gap, Chiranjeevi starred in Indra, released in 2002, which broke all his previous box office records of Tollywood and won him his third Nandi Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. After that, he appeared in films with an underlying message and a social cause, including Tagore; Shankar Dada M.B.B.S., for which he won his seventh and latest Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; and Stalin. He was awarded the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2006 and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in 2011 for his contributions to the film industry.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008–2016: Hiatus in film career ===\\n\\nFollowing his last film in the lead role, 2007\\'s Shankar Dada Zindabad, Chiranjeevi did not star in any film for approximately 10 years, during which he embarked on his political career. During these 10 years, his appearances in films were limited to cameo roles. He appeared as himself in two films, starring his son Ram Charan, namely Magadheera (2009) and Bruce Lee: The Fighter (2015). He also narrated Varudu (2010) and Rudhramadevi (2015).\\n\\n\\n=== 2017–present: Comeback ===\\nFrom 2013 onwards, he was on the lookout for the right script to mark his comeback into cinema, in what would coincidentally happen to be his 150th film as an actor. A year following the release of the highly successful 2014 Tamil film Kaththi, Chiranjeevi chose to remake that film in Telugu as his comeback film. The remake, titled Khaidi No. 150, directed by V. V. Vinayak, was released during the Sankranti holiday in 2017, about six months short of a decade following Shankar Dada Zindabad, to positive reviews. Critics have singled out Chiranjeevi in particular, praising him for both his performance and appearance, especially following a decade of absence from cinema. The movie collected ₹41.75 crore on its opening day and grossed ₹164 crore in its lifetime. In 2019, he starred in his first period film Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy based on the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy; it was directed by Surender Reddy. The movie made on a budget more than ₹200–270 crore, grossed more than ₹240 crore (equivalent to ₹337 crore or US$39 million in 2023) in its theatrical run.\\nChiranjeevi had two releases in 2022. His first film was Acharya directed by Koratala Siva co-starring Chiranjeevi\\'s son Ram Charan. His second release was GodFather directed by Mohan Raja. The film had Salman Khan in an extended cameo role and was largely successful. GodFather subsequently released on Netflix.\\nChiranjeevi then starred in the 2023 film Waltair Veerayya directed by Bobby Kolli which released during the Sankranti festival. The film also starred Ravi Teja in an important role, reuniting them on screen after 23 years since the 2000 film Annayya. The film met huge commercial success. Waltair Veerayya later released on Netflix for streaming. In the same year, he also appeared in Bhola Shankar, a remake of the 2015 Tamil blockbuster, Vedalam. However, it opened to unanimously negative reviews and was a huge disaster at the box-office.\\nHe announced his next film, Vishwambhara (2025), with Mallidi Vassishta of Bimbisara (2022) fame.\\n\\n\\n== Other work ==\\nChiranjeevi is one of the co-owners of the Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC.\\n\\n\\n=== Television career ===\\nChiranjeevi made his debut as a Television host with the fourth season of Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu. The first episode of the fourth season was aired on 13 February 2017 on Star Maa. The game show is a Telugu-language adaptation of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.\\n\\n\\n== Political career ==\\nIn August 2008, Chiranjeevi launched his political party, Praja Rajyam Party, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. At the launch, he stated that social justice was the main agenda of his party. In the 2009 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the party won 18 of the 294 seats and secured a vote share of over 16%. He contested from Tirupati and Palakollu constituencies winning in Tirupati but losing out in Palakollu, in West Godavari district.\\n\\nOn 6 February 2011, the Praja Rajyam Party merged with the Indian National Congress after two weeks of talks with Congress President Sonia Gandhi. The merger was influenced by the Congress party\\'s concerns over a no-confidence motion in the Andhra Pradesh state assembly, spurred by the rise of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy\\'s YSR Congress Party and the ongoing Telangana agitation. On 29 March 2012, Chiranjeevi was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, where he was elected and took his oath as a member on 3 April. Later that year, on 28 October, he was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism. In 2013, Chiranjeevi inaugurated the Incredible India Exhibition, a collaboration between the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. He also represented Incredible India at the 14th IIFA Awards ceremony held in Macau that same year.\\nAfter the split of the state of Andhra Pradesh leaving the residuary state with huge debt and little revenue in June 2014, most members of the Andhra Pradesh wing of Congress party left in protest. Chiranjeevi, however, remained with Congress and campaigned for it as chairman of Election Campaign Committee for 2014 parliamentary and assembly elections in the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. However, he refrained from contesting in elections. There was also speculation that he did not campaign wholeheartedly due to the one-sided decision taken to split Andhra Pradesh. His younger brother, Pawan Kalyan, a former Praja Rajyam Party youth wing leader, launched his own political party, Jana Sena Party, and campaigned vigorously against Congress and in favour of Telugu Desam Party and Bharatiya Janata Party. Due to the strong anti-Congress sentiment prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, its candidates were defeated in all parliamentary and state assembly seats of Andhra Pradesh.\\nSince the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then, has not attended any meetings of the Congress party, on a regional or national level. His tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018. Although he is currently not active in politics, he was issued with a new All India Congress Committee identity card in 2022 leading to the speculation of his political comeback.\\n\\n\\n== Humanitarian work ==\\nChiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT) on 2 October 1998, with the motto that no one should lose their life due to a lack of blood. The trust includes a blood bank and an eye bank and is the largest recipient of blood and eye donations in Andhra Pradesh. As of September 2022, CCT has collected over 930,000 units of blood, with 70% of it provided to the poor free of charge. It has restored eyesight to over 9,060 individuals through 4,580 cornea transplants, and more than 350,000 people have pledged their eyes to CCT. The trust has received several accolades, including the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" from the Andhra Pradesh State Government for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. On 10 June 2006, the then President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi has supported the trust\\'s activities through his earnings, including those from television commercials and promotions.\\nAfter Chiranjeevi\\'s entry into politics, actor couple Rajasekhar and Jeevitha made allegations against the Chiranjeevi Blood Bank, accusing it of engaging in financial irregularities. In response, the Andhra Pradesh state government formed a high-level committee to investigate the claims. The committee, guided by the project director of the AP State AIDS Control Society and composed of experts from finance and technical fields, thoroughly examined records related to blood collection and disposal, blood grouping, screening, sterilization, medical waste management, conducted camps, blood expiry, quality control, storage facilities, and equipment purchases. Following the investigation, the blood bank was cleared of any wrongdoing. Authorities confirmed that the blood bank operates in full compliance with the guidelines set by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). In 2023, a Nampally court sentenced Rajasekhar and Jeevitha to one year in jail and imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh for their defamatory remarks against the blood bank. The couple, however, obtained bail.\\nIn May 2021, Chiranjeevi set up oxygen banks and ambulances across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to meet the needs of patients affected by COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards, honours and recognitions ==\\nDirector K. Balachander said, \"Chiranjeevi has both Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in him. Not only can he do action, he can also act.\" Chiranjeevi received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in India in the year 2006. In the same year, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Andhra University for his contribution to films and his social service through the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust. He is a nine-time winner of Filmfare Awards South and a three-time winner of Nandi Awards. He was the first actor from South India to be invited to the Oscars ceremony in 1987. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2014, he was awarded International Face of Indian Cinema at the 3rd South Indian International Movie Awards by Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor. In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry for performing more than 24,000 dance moves in 537 songs in 156 films in a career spanning over 45 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Civilian honours ===\\n2006 – Padma Bhushan from the Government of India\\n2024 – Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India\\n\\n\\n=== National honours ===\\n2022 – IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award\\n2024 – ANR National Award He was given this by Amitabh Bachchan at the ceremony in October.\\n\\n\\n=== State honours ===\\n2016 – Raghupathi Venkaiah Award from the Government of Andhra Pradesh\\n\\n\\n=== Acting honours ===\\nFilmfare Awards South\\n\\nNandi Awards\\n\\nCinema Express Awards\\nBest Actor – Swayam Krushi (1987)\\nSantosham Film Awards\\nBest Actor – Khaidi No. 150 (2017)\\nZee Cine Awards Telugu\\nBest Actor – Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019)\\nOther honours\\n2006 – Honorary doctorate from the Andhra University\\nSIIMA Awards - International Face of Indian Cinema – (2014)\\n2024 – IIFA Utsavam Outstanding Achievement in Indian Cinema\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Indian actors\\nList of dancers\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nChiranjeevi at IMDb\\nChiranjeevi at Rotten Tomatoes'"

              "['Konidela Chiranjeevi (born Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad; 22 August 1955) is an Indian actor, politician, and philanthropist known for his work in Telugu cinema. Known as the \"Mega Star\", he is widely regarded as one of the most successful and influential actors in the history of Indian cinema. Chiranjeevi holds the record for the most \"Industry Hits\" in Telugu cinema, with eight films emerging as the top-grossers of their time—a feat unmatched by any actor in the industry\\'s 100-year history. He is also celebrated as one of the finest dancers in Indian cinema. He has received numerous honours, including the Padma Bhushan in 2006 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2024 from the Government of India, as well as the IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award in 2022. His other accolades include the Raghupathi Venkaiah Award, three Nandi Awards, and nine Filmfare Awards South, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry. \\nChiranjeevi made his acting debut in 1978, initially gaining recognition for his supporting, anti-hero, and antagonist roles. He later transitioned to lead roles with notable success. His breakthrough came with the 1983 film Khaidi, which became the highest-grossing Telugu film at the time and established him as a leading actor in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Chiranjeevi starred in various \"Industry Hits\"—highest-grossers of all time—like Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988), Attaku Yamudu Ammayiki Mogudu (1989), Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), Gang Leader (1991), and Gharana Mogudu (1992). Notably, Gharana Mogudu was the first South Indian film to earn over ₹10 crore in distributor share, prompting The Week magazine to label him \"Bigger than Bachchan\" and \"the new money machine.\"\\nFor his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), Chiranjeevi was paid ₹1.25 crore, making him the highest-paid actor in India at the time and the first Indian actor to command a ₹1 crore remuneration for a film. During this period, he received widespread critical acclaim for his performances in Swayamkrushi (1987), Rudraveena (1988), and Aapadbandhavudu (1992), showcasing his versatility as an actor who excelled in both commercial blockbusters and critically acclaimed films. Notably, Swayamkrushi was screened at the Moscow International Film Festival, while Rudraveena, which he co-produced, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Chiranjeevi continued to dominate the box office with films like Master (1997), and Choodalani Vundi (1998). His 2002 film Indra was the highest-grossing Telugu film for many years, and socially impactful films like Tagore (2003) and Shankar Dada M.B.B.S. (2004) became major blockbusters, further cementing his legacy.\\nOn 2 October 1998, Chiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust, which operates the largest blood and eye banks in the Telugu states. The trust has restored eyesight to over 9,000 individuals through cornea transplants and provides 70% of collected blood free to the poor. It has received several accolades, including the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" from the Government of Andhra Pradesh for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. In 2002, he was honoured with the Samman Award by the Income Tax Department, for being the highest income tax payer in the profession category for the assessment year 1999–2000.\\nIn 2008, Chiranjeevi founded the Praja Rajyam Party and led it in the 2009 Andhra Pradesh elections, where it won 18 seats and secured over 16% of the vote, making it the third-largest party in the state. The party merged with the Indian National Congress in 2011. Chiranjeevi served as a Rajya Sabha MP from 2012 to 2018 and was appointed Minister of Tourism in the central cabinet of India in October 2012, holding the position until May 2014. After a hiatus from cinema, he returned with the blockbuster hit Khaidi No. 150 (2017), followed by successful films such as Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019) and Waltair Veerayya (2023).\\n\\n\\n== Early and personal life ==\\nChiranjeevi was born as Konidela Sivasankara Varaprasad Rao on 22 August 1955 in a Telugu family to Konidela Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Mogalthur, West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. His father Konidela Venkata Rao worked as a constable and was transferred on a regular basis. He spent his childhood in his native village with his grandparents.\\nChiranjeevi did his schooling in Nidadavolu, Gurazala, Bapatla, Ponnur, Mangalagiri and Mogalthur. He was an NCC cadet and had participated in the Republic Day Parade in New Delhi in the early 1970s. He was interested in acting from a young age. He did his Intermediate at C. S. R. Sarma College in Ongole. After graduating with a degree in commerce from Sri Y N College at Narsapuram, Chiranjeevi moved to Chennai and joined the Madras Film Institute in 1976 to pursue a career in acting.\\nOn 20 February 1980, Chiranjeevi married Surekha, the daughter of Telugu comic actor Allu Ramalingaiah. They have two daughters, Sushmitha and Sreeja, and a son, Ram Charan, also an actor in Telugu cinema. Chiranjeevi has two brothers, Nagendra Babu, a film producer and actor, and Pawan Kalyan, an actor-politician who is Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and founder of Jana Sena, a regional political party. Allu Aravind, his brother-in-law, is a film producer. Chiranjeevi is the uncle to actors Allu Arjun, Varun Tej, Niharika, Sai Dharam Tej, and Panja Vaisshnav Tej.\\n\\n\\n== Acting career ==\\n\\n\\n=== 1978–1981: Early career ===\\nSince his family worshipped Anjaneya (Hanuman), a Hindu deity, his mother advised him to take the screen name \"Chiranjeevi\", meaning \"Immortal\", a reference to the belief of Hanuman living forever.\\nChiranjeevi started his film career with Punadhirallu (1979). However, his first released film was Pranam Khareedu (1978). Mana Voori Pandavulu (1978), directed by Bapu, gave Chiranjeevi recognition from the Telugu audience. He played a small role in Tayaramma Bangarayya (1979). He played the anti-hero in films I Love You (1979) and K. Balachander\\'s Idi Katha Kaadu (1979), starring Kamal Haasan.\\nIn a remake of the Tamil film Avargal (1977), Chiranjeevi portrayed the character played by Rajinikanth in the original. In 1979, Chiranjeevi had eight major film releases and then 14 films in the following year. In 1981, he played lead antagonist in works such as Mosagadu, Rani Kasula Rangamma, 47 Natkal /47 Rojulu, Nyayam Kavali and Ranuva Veeran.\\n\\n\\n=== 1982–1986: Breakthrough with leading roles ===\\nChiranjeevi began to appear in leading roles with films such as Intlo Ramayya Veedhilo Krishnayya (1982), directed by Kodi Ramakrishna, which was a hit at the box office. Later, he starred in Subhalekha (1982), directed by K. Viswanath, which dealt with the social malady of the dowry system. It brought him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Viswanath\\'s third Filmfare Award for Best Director – Telugu. In 1982, he also appeared in movies such as Idi Pellantara, Sitadevi, Tingu Rangadu, Bandhalu Anubandhalu and Mondi Ghatam. He acted in multi-star movies such as Patnam Vachina Pativrathalu and Billa Ranga, and later appeared in Manchu Pallaki.\\nKhaidi (1983) was a box office success and Chiranjeevi attained stardom with this movie. In 1984, he continued doing action films. A series of box office hits at this time include; Mantri Gari Viyyankudu, Sangharshana, Goonda, Challenge, Hero, Donga, Jwala, Adavi Donga, Kondaveeti Raja, Rakshasudu. In 1985, he received his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in Vijetha.\\n\\n\\n=== 1987–2007: Commercial success ===\\nChiranjeevi received his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for Swayamkrushi (1987), directed by K. Viswanath. Pasivadi Pranam (1987), Yamudiki Mogudu (1988) and Manchi Donga (1988) also did well at the box office. He co-produced and acted in Rudraveena (1988), which won the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, and the Nandi Special Jury Award. The title \"Megastar\" appeared for the first time in the title cards of the 1988 release Marana Mrudangam, marking its association with Chiranjeevi. During the shoot of Marana Mrudangam, Chiranjeevi was poisoned by a fan who attempted to get closer to him. The incident was recalled by Chiranjeevi in 2023, who took it lightly as an act of misguided admiration.\\nHe then experimented with Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari (1990), a fantasy film directed by K. Raghavendra Rao and produced by Aswini Dutt. Other notable works during this period include Kondaveeti Donga (1990), released in 70 mm format with 6-Track stereophonic sound, the cowboy film Kodama Simham (1990), and the social problem action film Gang Leader (1991). These films were major box-office successes and established Chiranjeevi as the \"Boss of Telugu cinema\". The 1992 film Gharana Mogudu was the first South Indian and Telugu film to collect over ₹10 crore in distributor share at the box office. The film was screened at the 1993 International Film Festival of India in the mainstream section.\\nChiranjeevi\\'s Bollywood performances were appreciated in Pratibandh and Aaj Ka Goonda Raaj. For his role in Aapadbandhavudu (1992), he received his second Nandi Award for Best Actor and third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The mid-1990s saw a career dip for Chiranjeevi with box office duds such as S. P. Parasuram, The Gentleman, Big Boss and Rikshavodu. There were exceptions, such as Muta Mestri, which fetched him a fourth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; Mugguru Monagallu and Alluda Majaka were also successful. In 1996, he appeared in a guest role in the Kannada film Sipayi. After a brief lull, Chiranjeevi bounced back with Hitler, Master, Bavagaru Bagunnara?, Choodalani Vundi and Sneham Kosam, for which he received his fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. In 1999, Chiranjeevi was to appear in a Hollywood production directed by Dushan Garsi, and produced by Rameshkrishna Murthi. The Telugu version was directed by Suresh Krissna. The movie, which was titled The Return of the Thief of Baghdad, had its filming suspended for undisclosed reasons.\\nChiranjeevi\\'s new decade started with Annayya (2000). After a brief gap, Chiranjeevi starred in Indra, released in 2002, which broke all his previous box office records of Tollywood and won him his third Nandi Award for Best Actor and sixth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. After that, he appeared in films with an underlying message and a social cause, including Tagore; Shankar Dada M.B.B.S., for which he won his seventh and latest Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu; and Stalin. He was awarded the Filmfare Special Award – South in 2006 and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award – South at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in 2011 for his contributions to the film industry.\\n\\n\\n=== 2008–2016: Hiatus in film career ===\\n\\nFollowing his last film in the lead role, 2007\\'s Shankar Dada Zindabad, Chiranjeevi did not star in any film for approximately 10 years, during which he embarked on his political career. During these 10 years, his appearances in films were limited to cameo roles. He appeared as himself in two films, starring his son Ram Charan, namely Magadheera (2009) and Bruce Lee: The Fighter (2015). He also narrated Varudu (2010) and Rudhramadevi (2015).\\n\\n\\n=== 2017–present: Comeback ===\\nFrom 2013 onwards, he was on the lookout for the right script to mark his comeback into cinema, in what would coincidentally happen to be his 150th film as an actor. A year following the release of the highly successful 2014 Tamil film Kaththi, Chiranjeevi chose to remake that film in Telugu as his comeback film. The remake, titled Khaidi No. 150, directed by V. V. Vinayak, was released during the Sankranti holiday in 2017, about six months short of a decade following Shankar Dada Zindabad, to positive reviews. Critics have singled out Chiranjeevi in particular, praising him for both his performance and appearance, especially following a decade of absence from cinema. The movie collected ₹41.75 crore on its opening day and grossed ₹164 crore in its lifetime. In 2019, he starred in his first period film Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy based on the life of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy; it was directed by Surender Reddy. The movie made on a budget more than ₹200–270 crore, grossed more than ₹240 crore (equivalent to ₹337 crore or US$39 million in 2023) in its theatrical run.\\nChiranjeevi had two releases in 2022. His first film was Acharya directed by Koratala Siva co-starring Chiranjeevi\\'s son Ram Charan. His second release was GodFather directed by Mohan Raja. The film had Salman Khan in an extended cameo role and was largely successful. GodFather subsequently released on Netflix.\\nChiranjeevi then starred in the 2023 film Waltair Veerayya directed by Bobby Kolli which released during the Sankranti festival. The film also starred Ravi Teja in an important role, reuniting them on screen after 23 years since the 2000 film Annayya. The film met huge commercial success. Waltair Veerayya later released on Netflix for streaming. In the same year, he also appeared in Bhola Shankar, a remake of the 2015 Tamil blockbuster, Vedalam. However, it opened to unanimously negative reviews and was a huge disaster at the box-office.\\nHe announced his next film, Vishwambhara (2025), with Mallidi Vassishta of Bimbisara (2022) fame.\\n\\n\\n== Other work ==\\nChiranjeevi is one of the co-owners of the Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC.\\n\\n\\n=== Television career ===\\nChiranjeevi made his debut as a Television host with the fourth season of Meelo Evaru Koteeswarudu. The first episode of the fourth season was aired on 13 February 2017 on Star Maa. The game show is a Telugu-language adaptation of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.\\n\\n\\n== Political career ==\\nIn August 2008, Chiranjeevi launched his political party, Praja Rajyam Party, in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. At the launch, he stated that social justice was the main agenda of his party. In the 2009 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, the party won 18 of the 294 seats and secured a vote share of over 16%. He contested from Tirupati and Palakollu constituencies winning in Tirupati but losing out in Palakollu, in West Godavari district.\\n\\nOn 6 February 2011, the Praja Rajyam Party merged with the Indian National Congress after two weeks of talks with Congress President Sonia Gandhi. The merger was influenced by the Congress party\\'s concerns over a no-confidence motion in the Andhra Pradesh state assembly, spurred by the rise of Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy\\'s YSR Congress Party and the ongoing Telangana agitation. On 29 March 2012, Chiranjeevi was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, where he was elected and took his oath as a member on 3 April. Later that year, on 28 October, he was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Tourism. In 2013, Chiranjeevi inaugurated the Incredible India Exhibition, a collaboration between the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, at the 66th Cannes Film Festival. He also represented Incredible India at the 14th IIFA Awards ceremony held in Macau that same year.\\nAfter the split of the state of Andhra Pradesh leaving the residuary state with huge debt and little revenue in June 2014, most members of the Andhra Pradesh wing of Congress party left in protest. Chiranjeevi, however, remained with Congress and campaigned for it as chairman of Election Campaign Committee for 2014 parliamentary and assembly elections in the residual state of Andhra Pradesh. However, he refrained from contesting in elections. There was also speculation that he did not campaign wholeheartedly due to the one-sided decision taken to split Andhra Pradesh. His younger brother, Pawan Kalyan, a former Praja Rajyam Party youth wing leader, launched his own political party, Jana Sena Party, and campaigned vigorously against Congress and in favour of Telugu Desam Party and Bharatiya Janata Party. Due to the strong anti-Congress sentiment prevailing in Andhra Pradesh, its candidates were defeated in all parliamentary and state assembly seats of Andhra Pradesh.\\nSince the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then, has not attended any meetings of the Congress party, on a regional or national level. His tenure as a Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018. Although he is currently not active in politics, he was issued with a new All India Congress Committee identity card in 2022 leading to the speculation of his political comeback.\\n\\n\\n== Humanitarian work ==\\nChiranjeevi established the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust (CCT) on 2 October 1998, with the motto that no one should lose their life due to a lack of blood. The trust includes a blood bank and an eye bank and is the largest recipient of blood and eye donations in Andhra Pradesh. As of September 2022, CCT has collected over 930,000 units of blood, with 70% of it provided to the poor free of charge. It has restored eyesight to over 9,060 individuals through 4,580 cornea transplants, and more than 350,000 people have pledged their eyes to CCT. The trust has received several accolades, including the \"Best Voluntary Blood Bank Award\" from the Andhra Pradesh State Government for five consecutive years from 2002 to 2006. On 10 June 2006, the then President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, inaugurated the Chiranjeevi Charitable Foundation (CCF) at Jubilee Hills in Hyderabad. Chiranjeevi has supported the trust\\'s activities through his earnings, including those from television commercials and promotions.\\nAfter Chiranjeevi\\'s entry into politics, actor couple Rajasekhar and Jeevitha made allegations against the Chiranjeevi Blood Bank, accusing it of engaging in financial irregularities. In response, the Andhra Pradesh state government formed a high-level committee to investigate the claims. The committee, guided by the project director of the AP State AIDS Control Society and composed of experts from finance and technical fields, thoroughly examined records related to blood collection and disposal, blood grouping, screening, sterilization, medical waste management, conducted camps, blood expiry, quality control, storage facilities, and equipment purchases. Following the investigation, the blood bank was cleared of any wrongdoing. Authorities confirmed that the blood bank operates in full compliance with the guidelines set by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). In 2023, a Nampally court sentenced Rajasekhar and Jeevitha to one year in jail and imposed a fine of ₹5 lakh for their defamatory remarks against the blood bank. The couple, however, obtained bail.\\nIn May 2021, Chiranjeevi set up oxygen banks and ambulances across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to meet the needs of patients affected by COVID-19.\\n\\n\\n== Filmography ==\\n\\n\\n== Awards, honours and recognitions ==\\nDirector K. Balachander said, \"Chiranjeevi has both Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth in him. Not only can he do action, he can also act.\" Chiranjeevi received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in India in the year 2006. In the same year, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Andhra University for his contribution to films and his social service through the Chiranjeevi Charitable Trust. He is a nine-time winner of Filmfare Awards South and a three-time winner of Nandi Awards. He was the first actor from South India to be invited to the Oscars ceremony in 1987. In 2013, CNN-IBN recognized him as one of \"the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema\". In 2014, he was awarded International Face of Indian Cinema at the 3rd South Indian International Movie Awards by Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor. In 2024, he was honoured with a Guinness World Record as the most prolific actor-dancer in the Indian film industry for performing more than 24,000 dance moves in 537 songs in 156 films in a career spanning over 45 years.\\n\\n\\n=== Civilian honours ===\\n2006 – Padma Bhushan from the Government of India\\n2024 – Padma Vibhushan from the Government of India\\n\\n\\n=== National honours ===\\n2022 – IFFI Indian Film Personality of the Year Award\\n2024 – ANR National Award He was given this by Amitabh Bachchan at the ceremony in October.\\n\\n\\n=== State honours ===\\n2016 – Raghupathi Venkaiah Award from the Government of Andhra Pradesh\\n\\n\\n=== Acting honours ===\\nFilmfare Awards South\\n\\nNandi Awards\\n\\nCinema Express Awards\\nBest Actor – Swayam Krushi (1987)\\nSantosham Film Awards\\nBest Actor – Khaidi No. 150 (2017)\\nZee Cine Awards Telugu\\nBest Actor – Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy (2019)\\nOther honours\\n2006 – Honorary doctorate from the Andhra University\\nSIIMA Awards - International Face of Indian Cinema – (2014)\\n2024 – IIFA Utsavam Outstanding Achievement in Indian Cinema\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of Indian actors\\nList of dancers\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nChiranjeevi at IMDb\\nChiranjeevi at Rotten Tomatoes']"
